<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>Hey there! I'm <strong>Yashwant A E</strong>, a B.Tech student specializing in <strong>Big Data Analytics</strong> at <strong>SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur (SRM KTR)</strong>. I hail from <strong>Hosur, Tamil Nadu</strong>, and I'm deeply passionate about technology, systems, and turning raw data into real impact.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm diving deep into the world of <strong>Full Stack Development</strong> — mastering both frontend and backend technologies to build complete, functional, and scalable applications. Whether it's databases, APIs, or React components, I'm all in.</p>

<p>My ambition? To become a <strong>Big Data-empowered Full Stack Engineer</strong> — someone who can not only build apps end-to-end but also make them smart with data-driven intelligence. I'm driven by curiosity, learning, and the thrill of building things that actually work.</p>
